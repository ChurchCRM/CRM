# How to Contribute
We love to hear ideas from our users! It's what makes this platform so great and versatile. If you have an idea to contribute, please take a few moments to share it with us!

The project welcomes, and depends on, contributions from developers and users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in several ways. A few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

## First Steps
1. Read this whole page "top to bottom."
2. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
3. Introduce yourself in the developer chat at [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ChurchCRM/CRM).
4. Take a look at the [Open Issues](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/issues) page. We've made it easy for beginners with the [good first issue](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/labels/good%20first%20issue) label — these are issues that should be relatively easy to fix.
5. Have fun!

### User Interface using AdminLTE

ChurchCRM utilizes the AdminLTE framework for its user interface. Follow these guidelines when working on the UI:

1. **Understanding AdminLTE:**
   - Familiarize yourself with [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/), the framework used for the ChurchCRM user interface.

2. **Making UI Changes:**
   - UI components are located in the `src` directory. Ensure your changes align with the design principles of AdminLTE.

3. **Custom Styling:**
   - If you need to add custom styling, do so in a modular and organized manner. Create separate CSS files for custom styles.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that UI changes are responsive and work well across different screen sizes.

### Slim MVC for New APIs and Pages

For new APIs and pages, ChurchCRM follows the Slim MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Follow these guidelines when working on new functionalities.

### Adding Tests with Cypress

We use Cypress for end-to-end testing. Follow the previously mentioned steps to set up Cypress and write tests for UI components and functionalities.

## Development Workflow

1. **Branching:**
   - Create a feature branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

2. **Coding Standards:**
   - Adhere to the existing coding standards and style, especially in UI components and MVC structures.

3. **Testing:**
   - Write tests for UI components and functionalities using Cypress.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update relevant documentation if your changes impact the UI or introduce new APIs/pages.

5. **Commit Messages:**
   - Use descriptive commit messages in the present tense.
   - For complete standards, see `.github/ai-preferences/`

## AI Preferences Standards

ChurchCRM uses **standardized AI agent preferences** to ensure consistent code quality. These apply to all contributors, whether working with AI assistance or manually.

### Quick Reference
**See `.github/ai-preferences/preferences.yml` for complete standards including:**
- ✅ **Database:** Propel ORM mandatory (no raw SQL)
- ✅ **HTML5:** Bootstrap CSS only, no deprecated attributes
- ✅ **Asset Paths:** Use `SystemURLs::getRootPath()`
- ✅ **Services:** Business logic in Service classes
- ✅ **Objects:** Validate with `=== null`, never `empty()`
- ✅ **CSS:** Webpack bundled, no CDN links

### Using AI Assistance
If using GitHub Copilot or Claude:
1. Reference `.github/ai-preferences/preferences.yml` in your conversation or tool settings
2. Verify all code follows standards before committing
3. Run pre-commit checks: `php -l src/YourFile.php`
4. See `.github/ai-preferences/setup.md` for detailed tool integration

### AI Preferences Directory
**Location:** `.github/ai-preferences/`

**Contains:**
- `README.md` - Overview & file reference
- `preferences.yml` - Core standards (used by all agents)
- `setup.md` - Detailed setup guide for Copilot and Claude

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Rebase your branch if necessary:
   ```bash
   git rebase main
   ```

3. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

4. Submit a pull request via GitHub.
