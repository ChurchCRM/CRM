# Previous Versions Vagrant Environment

If you're doing development work, and need to run an old release of ChurchCRM for testing, I've created the /vagrant/perviousversions folder. 

All you need to do is uncomment the version number you want in VersionToLaunch file, and run ```vagrant up```

You'll get a new VM on 192.168.10.12 with the selected version.
