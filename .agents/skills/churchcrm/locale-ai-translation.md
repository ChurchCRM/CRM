# AI Locale Translation

Automates translation of missing terms across all 45+ locales using Claude Code, applying church-specific ecclesiastical vocabulary rules for each denomination and region.

No API key or external service is required — translations run directly inside Claude Code.

---

## Overview

Every new UI string added to ChurchCRM creates a translation gap in 45+ languages. The AI translation system bridges that gap at release time by:

1. Reading empty batch files from `locale/terms/missing/{locale}/*.json` (generated by `npm run locale:missing`)
2. Translating missing values with Claude Code, applying denomination-aware church vocabulary
3. Writing translated values back into the same batch files
4. User uploads those files to POEditor (source of truth), then pulls down via `npm run locale:download`

**Key files:**
- Helper script: `locale/scripts/locale-translate.js` (file I/O only, no AI calls)
- Claude Code skill: `.claude/commands/locale-translate.md` — invoke with `/locale-translate`
- Release workflow: `.claude/commands/locale-release.md` — invoke with `/locale-release`

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Regenerate missing terms list
npm run locale:missing

# 2. Preview what needs translation
npm run locale:translate:list
```

Then in Claude Code:
```
/locale-translate --all
```

Then upload `locale/terms/missing/**/*.json` to POEditor, and pull back:
```bash
npm run locale:download
```

## Claude Code Skills

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/locale-translate` | `--locale <code>` | Translate one locale |
| `/locale-translate` | `--all` | Translate all locales with missing terms |
| `/locale-translate` | `--list` | List locales with missing terms |
| `/locale-release` | _(no args)_ | Full guided release workflow |

---

## npm Scripts (file operations only)

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run locale:missing` | Regenerate missing-terms batch files |
| `npm run locale:translate:list` | List locales with untranslated terms |
| `npm run locale:audit` | Show translation coverage report |
| `npm run locale:download` | Pull approved translations from POEditor |

---

## Church Vocabulary Rules

These rules are applied automatically by the `/locale-translate` skill:

| English (CRM generic) | Church-appropriate translation |
|---|---|
| Members / Users / Clients | Congregation / Parishioners / Faithful |
| Leads / Prospects | Visitors / Seekers |
| Groups | Small Groups / Life Groups / Ministries |
| Giving / Payments / Transactions | Offerings / Tithes / Stewardship / Contributions |
| Pledge | Financial pledge / commitment to the church |
| Deposit (church finance) | Offering deposit |
| Cart (people selection) | Selection / List |
| Family | Family — keep as-is |

Standard UI terms (Save, Cancel, Delete, etc.) → normal native-language UI translations.

Format specifiers (`%d`, `%s`, `%1$s`, etc.) are preserved verbatim.

## Plural Forms

Batch files use this shape for plural terms:
```json
{ "%d person": { "one": "", "other": "" } }
```

The skill provides grammatically correct singular and plural forms per the target language's rules:
```json
{ "%d person": { "one": "1 personne", "other": "%d personnes" } }
```

---

## When to Run

**At every release that includes new UI strings:**
1. After `locale:build` has updated `locale/messages.json`
2. Run `/locale-release` for the full guided workflow
3. Upload translated batch files to POEditor
4. Run `npm run locale:download` and commit `src/locale/i18n/`
