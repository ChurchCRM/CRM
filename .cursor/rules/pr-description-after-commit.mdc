# PR Description After Code Changes

When completing any task that results in code changes (committed or not), **always append a ready-to-use PR description at the very end of your response summary**. Format it in a markdown code block so the user can quickly copy/paste when opening a pull request.

**Placement:** The PR description block must be the **last thing** in your reply—after the summary, after any other content. Make it easy to spot and copy.

**Format (inside a ```markdown code block):**
1. **Title** – Clear, concise one-line summary
2. **Summary** – What changed and why
3. **Checklist** – Testing done, docs updated (if applicable)
4. **Screenshots/setup** – Only if relevant
