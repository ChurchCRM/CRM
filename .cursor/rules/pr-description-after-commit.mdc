# PR Description After Commits

After committing changes on a branch, **always provide a ready-to-use PR description** that the user can paste when opening a pull request.

The PR description should include:

1. **Title** – Clear, concise summary
2. **Summary** – What changed and why
3. **Checklist** – If applicable (e.g., testing done, docs updated)
4. **Screenshots/setup** – Only if relevant to the changes
