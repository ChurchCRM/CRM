# ChurchCRM Agent Behavior

## Documentation
- DO NOT create unnecessary .md review/planning docs unless requested
- Make code changes directly without documentation overhead

## Git
- DO NOT auto-commit without explicit user request
- DO ask permission before committing: "Ready to commit? [describe changes]"
- Use `git mv` for file moves to preserve history

## PR Descriptions
- ALWAYS output PR description in a Markdown code block
- Include: Summary, Changes (bulleted), Why, Files Changed
- Use imperative mood

## API Tests
- Add API tests when creating new endpoints
- Location: `cypress/e2e/api/private/standard/` or `admin/`
- Required: success case, validation, auth (401)
