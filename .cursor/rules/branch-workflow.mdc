# Git Branch Workflow

**For any command that results in code changes:**

1. **Create a new branch** before making edits. Do not work directly on `master`.
2. **Never commit to `master`.** All commits must be on a feature/task branch.
3. Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `chore/webpack-upgrade`, `feat/add-login`, `fix/button-styling`).
4. If the user is on `master` with uncommitted changes, create a new branch first so the changes are captured there.
