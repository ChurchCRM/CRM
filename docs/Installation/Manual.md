# Manual Installation

Currently as ChurchCRM is still in development an install script is not yet available. ChurchCRM can run on a LAMP server (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP) or a Shared Hosting account through a manual installation.

## Check your server

[Upload] (https://github.com/ChurchCRM/Check) `check.php` to your web server's document root, and then visit `check.php` in a web browser.

This page should tell you everything that you need to know about if you can run ChurchCRM or not. 

[More at our check repo] (https://github.com/ChurchCRM/Check) 

## How Do I Install ChurchCRM?

1. [Download the latest release] (https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/releases/latest)

2. The downloaded zip file contains a directory called "churchcrm"
Extract the files and place the contents into a directory in the document root of your Web server or via FTP to a shared hosting account

3. Create a Church CRM blank db and user that have full permissions on the db.

 - For shared hosting accounts you must create a database within your hosting control panel

 - For LAMP servers, log onto your database server under the root account (or other account
allowed to create databases), create a database for ChurchCRM.

For example:

mysqladmin -u [user] -p create [database-name]

4. You should be able to access ChurchCRM at "http://[servername]/churchcrm". and a setup page will help with the next steps
    
   - the setup will create a file called Config.php in Include Dir. 
   - the $sRootPath option properly as described in Config.php.  

The database script will have set up an initial user called "**Admin**" with a password of "**changeme**" (passwords are case insensitive). You will be prompted to change this password upon login.  Once you have created other user accounts, you may delete or rename this default account.  Just make sure that you always have a user with administrative privledges.

## Other Technical Information

- You may need to change the default TrueType font path for the included
JPGraph library used for the daily donation report.  To do this, you must
edit line 38 of the file Include/jpgraph-1.13/src/jpgraph.php.  If you
have JPGraph and FPDF elsewhere on your server, you can specify where in
the general settings page.

Security Considerations:
---------------------
- If you are using the database backup utility, you need to make sure
that the churchcrm/SQL directory is not accessible to your users!
Otherwise, with the right timing, anybody can download the temporary
files used in creating database backups and thus read the entire contents
of the database!  Different web servers have different means of access
control.  In Apache, for example, you might add a section something
like this to your httpd.conf:

<Directory /home/httpd/html/churchcrm/SQL>
 Order deny,allow
 Deny from all
</Directory>

Please see your web server's documentation if you need further help.
