# Families

A Family is a group of [Person](./persons.md) records. Person records are grouped into Families for three reasons:

- To represent the social constructs of the family within the church
- To share information common to all members — address, phone number, email address, etc.
- To support the church financially as a single unit (a "pledge unit")

> **Every Person should belong to a family**, even if they are a family of one.

## Adding a New Family

1. From the left menu, select **People → Add New Family**
2. Enter the family's last name, address, phone, and email
3. You can add up to ten family members directly from this form — enter each person's first name and other details. Only enter a last name for a member if it differs from the family last name.
4. Click **Save**

## Viewing a Family

There are two ways to find and view a family:

1. **Search:** Type the family name in the search field at the top of the page, select **Family**, and press Enter
2. **Browse:** Click **People → View All Families** to see the full list

## Editing a Family

1. Bring up the Family View (search or browse)
2. Click **Edit this Family**
3. Make your changes and click **Save**

---

## Deleting a Family

1. Bring up the Family View
2. Click **Delete this Record**

> If the link does not appear, either you lack delete permissions or the family still has Person records assigned to it. You must remove or reassign all members before deleting a family.

3. Confirm the deletion

## Deactivating and Reactivating a Family

Use deactivation instead of deletion when a family leaves the church but you want to keep their history.

**To deactivate:**
1. Bring up the Family View
2. Click **Deactivate this family**
3. Confirm — a banner will appear: "This family is deactivated."

**To reactivate:**
1. Search for the family (deactivated families still appear in search)
2. Click **Activate this family**
3. Confirm — the deactivation banner will disappear

## Family Roles

Family Roles describe each person's position in the family (e.g., Head, Spouse, Child).

**To manage available roles:**
1. Go to **People → Family Roles Manager**
2. Add, rename, reorder, or delete roles
3. Click **Save Changes** before using the up/down/delete buttons — unsaved changes will be lost

## Inherited Information (Red Text)

On a Person view, some information may appear in **red text**. This means that information is inherited from the family record rather than stored on the individual person.

**Example:** If the Smith family has an address on the family record but no address on each person's record, all family members show the family address in red. If Sally goes to college and you enter a dorm address on her person record, her address will show in black (her own data), while the other family members still show the family address in red.

This makes it easy to update a shared address for all family members at once.
