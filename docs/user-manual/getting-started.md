# Getting Started with ChurchCRM

This guide walks you through the most important first steps after your ChurchCRM installation is complete.

> **Just installed?** Your first login credentials are **Username:** `admin` / **Password:** `changeme`. Change this password immediately.

## Step 1 — Change Your Admin Password

After your first login you will be prompted to change your password. Use a strong, unique password. You can manage user accounts under **Admin → Users**.

---

## Step 2 — Configure Your Church Details

Before adding any data, enter your church's basic information. This appears on reports, letters, and printed documents.

1. Go to **Admin → Edit General Settings**
2. Select the **Report Settings** tab
3. Enter your church name, address, phone, and email
4. Click **Save Settings**

## Step 3 — Set Up Your First Family

ChurchCRM organizes people into families. Even a person who lives alone should be in their own family record.

1. From the left menu, click **People → Add New Family**
2. Enter the family's last name, address, phone, and email
3. Add up to ten family members directly from this form
4. Click **Save**

See the full [Families guide](./families.md) for more detail.

## Step 4 — Understand Classifications

Classifications describe each person's relationship to the church (Member, Guest, Regular Attender, etc.).

- Go to **Admin → Manage Classifications** to create or edit classifications
- Assign a classification to each person when you add them

See [Persons](./persons.md) for more detail.

---

## Step 5 — Create Your Groups

Groups represent any collection of people in your church — Bible studies, committees, volunteer teams, Sunday School classes, and more.

1. From the left menu, click **Groups → Add a New Group**
2. Give the group a name, description, and type
3. Add people using the [Cart](./search-and-cart.md)

See the full [Groups guide](./groups.md) for more detail.

---

## Step 6 — Set Up Events (Optional)

If you track attendance or run a check-in system, set up event types and events:

1. Go to **Events → List Event Types** and create a type (e.g., "Sunday Service")
2. Go to **Events → Add Church Event** to create individual events

See the full [Events guide](./events.md) for more detail.

---

## Step 7 — Set Up Finances (Optional)

If your church tracks giving and pledges:

1. Go to **Fundraiser → Edit Fundraiser** to create donation funds
2. Add pledges from individual Family views
3. Enter donations as they are received

> **Note:** Only users with Finance permissions can see financial data. Configure permissions under **Admin → Users**.

See the full [Finances guide](./finances.md) for more detail.
