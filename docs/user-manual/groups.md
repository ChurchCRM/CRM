# Groups

A Group is a collection of [People](./persons.md) who occupy Roles within the Group. Groups represent organizational, educational, and social constructs within your church.

**Example:** A group called "Friday Night Bible Study" might have the roles Leader, Assistant Leader, and Member. If 16 people belong to this group, 13 might be Members, 2 might be Assistant Leaders, and 1 might be the Leader.

### Adding a Role

### The Default Role

Every group has a Default Role — the standard role for most members (e.g., "Student" in a class). When you add people to a group from the Cart, they are all assigned the Default Role automatically.

**To change the Default Role:**
1. In the **Group Roles** section, find the role you want to make the default
2. Click **Make Default**
