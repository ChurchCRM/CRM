# Groups

A Group is a collection of [People](person.md), all of which occupy Roles within the Group. Groups can be used to represent organization, educational, and social constructs within the church.

For example, a Group may be "Friday Night Bible Study." Roles within this group may be Leader, Assistant Leader, and Member. If 16 people are assigned to this group, 13 may occupy the Role of Member, 2 may occupy the Role of Assistant Leader, and 1 may occupy the Role of Leader.

## What is the Default Role?

Every Group has a Default Role, which is simply the "standard" Role for a Member of that Group. For a class, for instance, the Default Role might be Student, because 95% of the people in the class will be Students. There will be other Roles -- Teacher, Assistant Teacher, etc. -- but most everyone will be a Student, so that's the Default Role.

Default Roles allow you to quickly add new Members to a group. If you have 200 People in your Cart, you don't have to specify Roles for every record to dump the Cart to a Group, they are simply added as the Default Role. This also allows quick sorting of the organizers of a Group. The Group View producers all Members of a Group who do not occupy the Default Role, which are usually the organizers and administrators of the Group.

## What is Group Type?

Group types allow you to categorize your groups. For example, a group called "Gleaners Class" can be type "Sunday School" and a group called "Franklin House" can be type "Cell Groups". This helps in further classifying groups so that you don't have to memorize which group is associated with which type.
