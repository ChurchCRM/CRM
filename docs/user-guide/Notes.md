# Notes

A Note is just a miscellaneous memo assigned to a [Person](person.md) or [Family](families.md) record. Any User with the Notes [permission](Administration.md) can add a Note, and as many Notes as desired can be added to a Person or Family record.
Notes can be public, meaning every User can see them, or private, meaning only the User who authored the Note can read it on subsequent views of the Person or Family record. Notes can be deleted or edited as desired.
