# Properties

A Property is a label that can be applied to a [Person](person.md), a [Group](Groups.md), or a [Family](families.md). Separate sets of Properties are defined for the three different record types, and new properties can be created as need. A record can be assigned an unlimited number of Properties.

Additionally, Properties can have values which contain information related to that Property. For example, a Property for a Person record might be "Hospitalized." A person with this Property is currently in the hospital, and the value of this Property could contain the name of the hospital and the room number.

## How do I know what Properties have been assigned?
