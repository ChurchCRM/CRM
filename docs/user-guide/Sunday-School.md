# Sunday School

## How do I create a Sunday School Class?
Sunday school classes are nothing more than [groups](Groups.md), with the "Type" set to "Sunday School Class."  To this effect, you can create Sunday School Classes by following these steps:

1. Select _"Groups"_

2. Select _"Add a new Group"_

3. Enter the Name of the Sunday School Group, and set the _"Type of Group"_ to _"Sunday School Class"_

4. Replace the default role text of "Member" to "Teacher"

5. Click _"Save Changes"_

6. Enter "Student" in the _"New Role Name"_ text box, and click _"Add New Group Member Role"_

7. Add users to the group as either "Teacher" or "Student"

## How do I use ChurchCRM to track attendance?

Sunday School Attendance cannot be tracked directly, but rather by creating an [Event](Events.md).  Please see the [events section](Events.md) of the documentation

## How can I use ChurchCRM to notify parents if their child requires attention?

Navigate to the Sunday School Dashboard of the group you wish to contact, and click the _"Compose Message"_ button.
