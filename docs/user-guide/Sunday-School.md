3. Enter the Name of the Sunday School Group, and set the _"Type of Group"_ to _"Sunday School Class"_

4. Replace the default role text of "Member" to "Teacher"

5. Click _"Save Changes"_

6. Enter "Student" in the _"New Role Name"_ text box, and click _"Add New Group Member Role"_

7. Add users to the group as either "Teacher" or "Student"
