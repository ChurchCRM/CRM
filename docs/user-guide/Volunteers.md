# Volunteers

This feature is used to keep track of talent and the willingness of volunteers for specific tasks. For example, some volunteer opportunities might be “Baking”, “Babysitting”, “Lawn Mowing”, etc. When a need arises, the Volunteers query may be used to find people who are willing to serve.

After you have created some volunteer types and have associated them with individuals, you then need to query the data. For instance, if I have a need for baby sitting, how do you display the list of 5 people who have volunteered for babysitting?

1. Select _"Data/Reports → Query Menu"_

2. Down at the bottom, click _"Volunteers"_

3. [People](person.md) can be added to the cart after the query identifies them.

4. Once they are in the cart you can make a mini-directory for contact information, print address labels, etc.
