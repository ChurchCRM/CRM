# Events

The ChurchCRM events module allows you to create events and track attendance, visitor numbers, and who needs to be followed up.

## What is an Event?

- An Event is an occasion that may, or may not, be hosted at your location.

- In it's basic usage, an Event could be a Worship Service or Sunday School. It could also be a fundraiser, a picnic, etc.

- By using the Event module you can generate reports on who showed up, who didn't, and a list of any guests attended.

- Events are created using a template called an _Event Type_.
