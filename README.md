# Status 

Hello everyone,

I wanted to provide an update on the current status of our project. As you may have noticed, there has been little new feature / dev activity recently, and I wanted to explain why.

At the moment, we do not have any active developers working on the project. However, we are committed to ensuring that the software remains secure and up-to-date with the latest localization improvements as people contribute them.

Rest assured that we are still monitoring the project and will be available to review any pull requests that are submitted. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience and understanding

The Church CRM team.
