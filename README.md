# ChurchInfoWeb -> ChurchWebCRM
ChurchInfo is a free church database program to help churches track members, families, groups, pledges and payments. I have fully Forked the proejct into a new Code base that will start to differ from the one managed at Sourceforge.net/projects/churchinfo/

**if you want the new project checkout [ChurchWebCRM/ChurchWebCRM](https://github.com/ChurchWebCRM/ChurchWebCRM)** and visit 

[ChurchWebCRM.com] (http://ChurchWebCRM.com)

Here is what the new UI looks like
