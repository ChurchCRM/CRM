# Community Plugins Directory

This directory is for third-party community plugins.

To install a community plugin:
1. Download the plugin
2. Extract to a subdirectory here (e.g., `src/plugins/community/my-plugin/`)
3. Ensure the plugin has a valid `plugin.json` manifest
4. Enable the plugin in Admin → Plugins

See the main README.md in the plugins directory for development documentation.
