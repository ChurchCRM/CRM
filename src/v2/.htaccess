RewriteEngine On

# Automatically handle subdirectory installations
# The RewriteRule will pass the matched path to index.php
# Slim will use the base path from Config.php ($sRootPath) to match routes correctly
# 
# NOTE: If you have issues with routing, you may need to set RewriteBase manually:
# For root installation (/): RewriteBase /v2
# For subdirectory (/churchcrm): RewriteBase /churchcrm/v2
# For subdirectory (/xyz): RewriteBase /xyz/v2

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
