## Thanks for opening an issue!

We couldn't auto-detect the issue type. This repo uses GitHub's issue type/template feature — please:

**Edit this issue and set the type to "bug" or "question"** so we can route it correctly.

**For bug reports**, please include:
- A short summary of the problem
- Steps to reproduce (if you have them)
- Any relevant logs or screenshots (redact private data)

**To collect system debug info**, if you're an admin:

👉 **Admin → System Maintenance → System Logs** (or click the debug icon)

Attach logs/screenshots when you set the issue type.

**Advanced users**: If the issue is reproducible in the UI, the Cypress Recorder helps. Capture the steps and attach an exported spec.

👉 **[Bug Reporting & Diagnostics Guide](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/wiki/Bug-Reporting-and-Diagnostics)**

Set the issue type and we'll follow up with questions. Thank you! 🙏
