## Thanks for the bug report!

To help us investigate quickly, please provide:

- **ChurchCRM version**: Check the page footer or debug section
- **Problem summary**: One sentence describing what went wrong
- **Steps to reproduce**: How to trigger the issue (numbered steps help)
- **Logs/screenshots**: Attach if available (please redact private data)

**Fastest way to collect debug info** — If you're an admin:

👉 **Admin → System Maintenance → System Logs** (or click the debug icon)

If you used the in-app reporter, we likely already have system details.

**Screenshots speed up triage**: A quick image helps us understand the issue faster.

**Advanced users**: If this is a UI workflow reproducible in the browser, a Cypress Recorder capture (exported spec) helps us add a test quickly.
