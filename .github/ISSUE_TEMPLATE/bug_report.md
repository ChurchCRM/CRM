## Quick, friendly bug report

Thanks for helping us improve ChurchCRM. Clear details help us triage and fix bugs faster.

Please share:
- **What happened**: One or two sentences describing the problem
- **Steps to reproduce**: How to trigger the issue (numbered steps help)
- **What you expected**: What should have happened instead

If you cannot use the in-app reporter, add environment details:
- ChurchCRM version (check the page footer or debug section)
- PHP / Database / Hosting (if relevant)

If you're an admin and can access the app, the fastest way to collect debug info:

**Admin → System Maintenance → System Logs** (or click the debug icon). Attach logs/screenshots if available — please redact private data.

**Screenshots help**: If you can capture a quick image, it speeds up our investigation.

**Advanced users**: If this is a UI workflow reproducible in the browser, a Cypress Recorder capture (exported spec) helps us add tests faster.
