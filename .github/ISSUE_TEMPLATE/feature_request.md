## Share your feature idea

Tell us in a sentence or two:
- **What you'd like to see**: The feature or improvement
- **Why it matters**: The problem it solves or how it would help

Examples or screenshots are great — short notes work too! Thanks for the idea! 💡

**Need system info?** Admins can find system logs at:

**Admin → System Maintenance → System Logs** (or click the debug icon).

**Advanced users**: If this relates to a UI workflow you can reproduce, a Cypress Recorder capture (exported spec) helps us prototype and validate faster.
