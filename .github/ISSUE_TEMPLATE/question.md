## How can we help?

Please share briefly:
- **What you're trying to do**: Your goal or workflow
- **What you've tried**: Steps or settings you've attempted
- **Expected behavior**: What you expected to happen

Add environment details only if relevant (version, hosting type, etc.).

**Need system info?** If you're an admin:

**Admin → System Maintenance → System Logs** (or click the debug icon). Attach logs or screenshots if helpful — please redact private data.

**Screenshots help**: A quick image can clarify your question.

**Advanced users**: If this is a UI flow you can reproduce, the Cypress Recorder helps. Capture the steps and attach an exported spec.

Short answers are fine — we'll follow up if needed. Thanks! 🙏
