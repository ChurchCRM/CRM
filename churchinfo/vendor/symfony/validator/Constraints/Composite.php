     *     are merged and used as groups for the composite constraint;
     *
     *   - If groups are passed explicitly to both the composite and its nested
     *     constraints, the groups of the nested constraints must be a subset
     *     of the groups of the composite constraint. If not, a
     *     {@link ConstraintDefinitionException} is thrown.
     *
     * All this is done in the constructor, because constraints can then be
     * cached. When constraints are loaded from the cache, no more group
     * checks need to be done.
