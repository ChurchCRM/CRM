# 🔧 ChurchCRM 6.5.1 — Asset Caching & Log Fixes

Released: December 2025

---

A quick patch released the same day as 6.5.0 addressing two issues discovered immediately after release.

---

## Fixes

- **Automatic cache-busting** added for all static assets — browsers now always load the latest CSS and JavaScript after an upgrade without needing a hard refresh
- **System logs API** response format fixed — logs were not displaying correctly in the admin interface
