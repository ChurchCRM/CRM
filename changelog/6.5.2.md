# 🔧 ChurchCRM 6.5.2 — People API Stability

Released: December 2025

---

A same-day patch fixing a DataTables warning that appeared in certain member list views.

---

## Fix

- **Person API** now always includes `Created` and `LastEdited` fields in responses — prevents DataTables from logging console warnings when these fields were missing from the data set
