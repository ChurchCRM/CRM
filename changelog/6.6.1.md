# 🔧 ChurchCRM 6.6.1 — Reports, Events & Visual Polish

Released: December 2025

---

## 💰 Financial Reports — Advanced Deposit Fixes

- **Advanced Deposit Report** — fixed incorrect UNDESIGNATED/UNASSIGNED entries appearing in reports (issue #7854)
- **Advanced Deposit Report fund totals** — summary totals were incorrect in some configurations (issue #7864)
- **Fiscal year display** corrected; `SystemConfig::getIntValue()` method added for robust integer config reading

---

## 📅 Event Editor Improvements

- **Event Editor** migrated to Propel ORM for data access — more reliable and consistent
- Time picker UX improved
- Event listing now shows more clearly organized event metadata

---

## 🧩 Group Properties & Roles

- **Insert before update** — fixed a bug where updating a group property could fail if the record hadn't been inserted first (issue #7388)
- **Group properties and roles errors** resolved (issue #7652)
- **Bidirectional navigation** added between Property Types and Properties — you can now navigate from a type to its properties and back

---

## 🎨 Visual & UI Updates

- **ChurchCRM icons and logos updated** — new icons applied throughout, including the login screen
- Bootstrap 5 class usage corrected (`w-100` used instead of `btn-block` where appropriate)
- PHP syntax validation pipeline added to CI to catch syntax errors before they reach production

---

## ⚙️ Technical

- Deprecated PHP 8.5 functions (`curl_close`, `imagedestroy`, `finfo_close`) removed — future-proofing for upcoming PHP releases
- Only 2FA-related secret key warnings shown when 2FA is actually enabled — reduces noise for sites not using two-factor authentication
