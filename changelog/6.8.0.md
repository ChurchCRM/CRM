## 📟 Check-in Kiosk — Full Redesign

The Check-in Kiosk has been completely rebuilt as a modern, reliable module:

- **New TypeScript/webpack bundle** — the kiosk now uses the same modern build pipeline as the rest of the application, replacing a fragile legacy JavaScript implementation
- **Re-registration flow** fixed — guests re-registering no longer encounter errors or get stuck in a loop
- **Alert button** visibility and feedback improved — the kiosk alert button is now clearly visible and provides confirmation when triggered
- **Notification emails** for kiosk alerts working reliably
- **User-friendly error page** added for kiosk error states — instead of a blank screen, visitors see a clear message and next steps
- **Input validation and null checks** added to all kiosk API endpoints
- **Inline CSS moved to webpack SCSS** — kiosk styling is now part of the standard build process

## 📊 CSV Export — Open to All Users

CSV export is now available to all authenticated users — the old `bExportCSV` permission flag has been removed. Administrators no longer need to manually enable this permission for each user.

**Removed settings:**
- `bExportCSV` user permission flag
- `bCSVAdminOnly` system setting

## ⚙️ Dependencies

- **pdfmake** upgraded from 0.2.21 to 0.3.1 — improved PDF rendering reliability and security
