## 💰 Financial Reports — Smarter Date Handling

The Advanced Deposit Report has been significantly improved:

- **Date filtering** now works correctly across all financial reports — `DateStart` / `DateEnd` filters are preserved when navigating between views
- **No-data redirects** properly carry date parameters forward so you don't lose your filter settings
- **Deposits with no payments** are now handled gracefully: the system shows a clear notification rather than generating a broken PDF
- **PDF export** blocked for empty deposits with a user-friendly message instead of a silent failure
- **INNER JOIN** for deposit date filtering corrected — dates were previously matched incorrectly

## 🖥️ Administration Area Consolidated

All system administration is now in one place:

- **System Upgrade** consolidated at `/admin/system/upgrade` — no more hunting through multiple menus
- **Email debug** moved to `/admin/system/debug/email` alongside other diagnostic tools
- **System Logs** integrated into the admin module
- **Quick Start** redesigned with a modern card grid and improved demo import experience
- **System Maintenance** menu item removed — all functionality lives in the Admin Dashboard

## 📊 Server Information

- **PHP version** now displayed in the Server Information panel, making it easier to verify your hosting environment meets requirements
