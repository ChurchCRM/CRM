# ✨ ChurchCRM 6.5.0 — Search, Photos & Simplified Families

> *Find anyone instantly. Cleaner member records. Smarter family management.*

Released: December 2025

---

## 🔍 New Global Search

The search experience has been completely rebuilt:

- **Moved to the top navigation bar** — search is now always accessible from any page, no need to navigate to a separate search page
- **Categorized results** — results are grouped by type (People, Families, Groups, etc.) with a clear summary
- **Better mobile responsiveness** — search works cleanly on phones and tablets used at the welcome desk

---

## 📷 Photo & Avatar System Overhaul

Profile photos across the application have been standardized:

- **Camera icons** placed consistently after names in all person and family tables
- **Photo icon placement** standardized — always after the name, never before, for a consistent visual rhythm
- **Avatar API** updated with improved initial generation for members without photos

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Simplified Family Records

Family records have been simplified to focus on individual contact information:

- **Family-level phone and email fields removed** (issue #7772) — contact information is now stored on individual members, which is more accurate and avoids confusion about which number to call
- **Family verification modal** added to the Family View — administrators can confirm and update family details inline

---

## 🌍 Localization

- Locale updated from POEditor
- Locale string improvements throughout
