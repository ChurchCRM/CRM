# 🔧 ChurchCRM 6.1.0 — Smarter Upgrade Detection

Released: November 2025

---

A targeted release fixing how ChurchCRM detects and displays available updates, ensuring administrators always see the correct upgrade options.

---

## Fixes & Improvements

- **Upgrade detection** — when pre-release upgrades are disabled, ChurchCRM now correctly uses the GitHub *latest release* API instead of pulling pre-release builds into the update check
- **Version comparison** logic normalized and fixed — resolves cases where the wrong version was flagged as available
- **Release sorting** corrected so the most recent stable version is always selected
- Locale updated from POEditor
