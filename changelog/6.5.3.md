# 🔧 ChurchCRM 6.5.3 — User Management & ChMeetings Export

Released: December 2025

---

## Improvements

- **ChMeetings export** — a new export button added to the CSV Export page lets you export congregation data in the format expected by ChMeetings, making it easier to sync between platforms
- **User management** modernized with an efficient service layer — the User List page migrated to the admin MVC structure for better consistency
- **API error handling** centralized: `renderErrorJSON` now sanitizes all error responses and logs exceptions server-side, so client-facing errors no longer accidentally expose internal details
- **Family API** routes corrected to use the proper REST pattern
