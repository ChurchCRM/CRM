# 🔧 ChurchCRM 6.5.4 — Upgrade Reliability & Search Polish

Released: December 2025

---

## Fixes & Improvements

- **Opcache cleared before database upgrade** — previously, a stale opcache could cause the version check to see the old version immediately after upgrading code, triggering a second unnecessary upgrade attempt. The upgrade now flushes opcache first.
- **Wedding date and birthday fields** always included in Family and Person API responses — prevents missing-field warnings in member list tables
- Search results refinements based on 6.5.3 feedback
