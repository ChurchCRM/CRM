#1.2.14 Vagrant Environment

The files in this folder should be placed one level above the "churchinfo" folder for the 1.2.14 release of [ChurchInfo](http://sourceforge.net/projects/churchinfo/files/latest/download?source=files)

After placing these files one level above "churchinfo", you can call the vagrant up command to get a working instance of ChurchInfo 1.2.14 for testing purposes.
