## Progress Log

### Session 1 - Family View Discovery Phase âœ“
**File:** `src/v2/templates/people/family-view.php`

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Button Layout & Consistency Issues:**
   - Navigation buttons (Previous Family, Family List, Next Family) use `.btn-app` which creates uneven spacing
   - Action buttons (Verify Info, Add New Member, Deactivate, Delete, Add Note, etc.) are in separate rows
   - Buttons wrap awkwardly on smaller screens
   - Different button colors are inconsistent (green, orange, maroon, olive)

2. **Specific Button Problems:**
   - "Previous Family", "Family List", "Next Family" buttons should be consolidated into a button group
   - "Verify Info" button is isolated on its own row
   - Buttons need better responsive design (collapse to single column on mobile)
   - Color scheme: green (Add), orange (Deactivate), maroon (Delete), olive (undefined), blue (List)
   - Button text positioning and icon alignment inconsistent

3. **Card Styling Issues:**
   - Family photo card uses `.card-primary` 
   - Navigation card uses `.card` (no color variant)
   - Inconsistent header styling between cards
   - Image container appears to need better styling

4. **Metadata Section Issues:**
   - Uses inline styles for color: `style="color:<?= ($family->isSendNewsletter() ? "green" : "red") ?>"`
   - Should use Bootstrap utility classes instead
   - Font sizing and spacing inconsistent
   - List icons (.fa-li) styling could be improved

5. **Responsive Design Issues:**
   - 6-column layout for photo, 8-column for actions - not optimal
   - No clear breakpoints for mobile/tablet
   - Long button text causes wrapping

#### Recommended Fixes:
- [ ] Create a button group for navigation buttons
- [ ] Consolidate action buttons into a logical grid (2-3 per row on desktop)
- [ ] Replace inline styles with Bootstrap utility classes
- [ ] Use consistent color scheme for similar actions
- [ ] Improve responsive layout for mobile devices
- [ ] Better spacing between button groups
- [ ] Use `.btn-group` or grid layout for button organization
